## Summary

## Lab Questions

### Compare and contrast One Hot and Binary encodings

### Which method did your team find easier, and why?

### In what conditions would you have to use one over the other? Think about resource utilization on the FPGA.

For quick and low number state state machines, a One Hot state machine seem to be easier and faster to implement. But for a state machine with many states, a Binary state machine uses way less resources and would thus be cheaper in computer power and recourses to implement.
